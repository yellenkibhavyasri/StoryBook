Here's an improved version of the project overview and getting started sections, specifically tailored for a GitHub README file. It's concise, scannable, and uses clear formatting.

ðŸš€ Project Overview
This repository contains a collection of reusable React components designed for building modern user interfaces. The core components include a flexible InputField and a powerful DataTable, both built with a focus on reusability, accessibility, and theming.

Components:

InputField: A versatile input component that supports various states (disabled, invalid, loading), variants (filled, outlined, ghost), and sizes (small, medium, large). It also includes optional features like a password toggle and a clear button, with full support for light and dark themes.

DataTable: A robust component for displaying tabular data. Features include column sorting, single/multiple row selection, and custom render functions. It also handles loading and empty states gracefully, with built-in theming and accessibility support.

All components are fully documented in Storybook, providing live examples, prop tables, and usage guidelines.
